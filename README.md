# Fraud Detection using Anomaly Detection & FastAPI

## Problem Statement

Fintech payment systems process millions of transactions daily, while fraudulent activity accounts for <0.5% of traffic.
The challenge is to detect fraud in real time under:

Extreme class imbalance

High false-positive cost (10× false-negative)

Strict latency requirement (<100 ms)

Need for explainable decisions

Traditional supervised models struggle in this setting, motivating an anomaly detection–based approach.

## Solution Overview

This project implements a production-ready fraud detection system using unsupervised anomaly detection models, deployed as a FastAPI service.

The solution is built in two layers:

### 1 Offline Modeling (Analysis & Benchmarking)

Isolation Forest

One-Class SVM

Autoencoder

Models were trained on engineered transactional features to understand fraud behavior and compare performance.
Failed approaches and limitations are documented in notebooks.

### 2 Online Behavioral Modeling (Production)

For real-time deployment, models were retrained on 4 stable behavioral features to ensure:

Low latency

Robustness to data drift

Human interpretability

## Behavioral Features Used
Feature: What it captures
amt_deviation	Unusual transaction amount
txn_count_cust	Sudden transaction bursts
cust_category_count	New or unfamiliar merchant category
distance_from_home	Geographic anomaly

Raw transaction data is first converted into these behavioral features before model inference.

### Models & Final Choice

Isolation Forest → Fast, stable baseline

One-Class SVM → Rejected (poor scalability & recall)

Autoencoder → Best performance (non-linear patterns)

Ensemble (IF + AE) → Improved recall

## Final Deployment Model: Behavioral Autoencoder
(Optional ensemble supported via configuration)

## Cost-Sensitive Decisioning

Given:

False Positive Cost = 10 × False Negative


Model thresholds and ensemble weights were optimized using a custom cost function, prioritizing business impact over raw accuracy.

Example Request
{
  "model_name": "autoencoder",
  "amt_deviation": 8200,
  "txn_count_cust": 14,
  "cust_category_count": 0,
  "distance_from_home": 220
}

Example Response
{
  "fraud_probability": 0.78,
  "risk_level": "High",
  "reasons": [
    "Transaction amount is unusually high",
    "Transaction occurred far from home"
  ]
}

### Key Design Decisions

✔ Separate offline analysis from online inference
✔ Avoid one-hot encodings in production
✔ Use behavioral signals instead of raw fields
✔ Optimize for business cost, not accuracy
✔ Keep the API fast, explainable, and configurable
